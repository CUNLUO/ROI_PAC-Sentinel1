  "body": "### What this code does.\r\nThis code makes ROI_PAC capable of handling Sentinel-1 TOPS data for interferometry.\r\n\r\n### How it works.\r\nThe method is described in the following paper :\r\n\r\n_Grandin, R., 2015. Interferometric processing of SLC Sentinel-1 TOPS data. In Proceedings of the European Space Agency, SP-371. FRINGE 2015, 23-27 March 2015, Frascati (Rome), Italy._\r\nThe paper can be found [here](http://www.ipgp.fr/~grandin/Raphael_Grandin_personal_web_page/Publications_files/Grandin_Fringe2015.pdf).\r\n\r\n### How to install it.\r\nYou will need to install a few python packages (mpmath, gdal, ...), to re-compile a few ROI_PAC routines and to add a few Perl scripts to your $MY_SCR folder. Everything is explained in the README file.\r\n\r\n### How to run it.\r\nYou will need to write a parameter file that tells the processor where your Sentinel-1 data are, where your DEM is. You can feed as many Sentinel-1 images as you want, as long as they are contiguous along the track and acquired on the same pass. A fine DEM is needed (30 m posting or better).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
